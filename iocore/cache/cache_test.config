# Each line in this config file has the following format:
# (data x). data can be either of these.
#
# users - the number of simultaneous connections to the Cache.
#         Default 1.
# requests - Maximum number of Read/Write requests to
#            the cache. The test stops after these number of
#            requests. Default 1
# buffer-size - read/write to the cache in 'x' kilobyte buffer blocks.
#               Default 32K. Maximum value 32K
# average-over - Display the ops/sec averaged over 'x' period
#                Default 1 sec
# run-length - Stop the Test after 'x'seconds
# num-alternates - Number of alternates. Default 1
# check-content - verify that the content read from the cache
#                 is the same as written. Default false
# hotset-probability - hit-rate. Default 1
# remove-proabability  - Remove objects from the Cache with
#                        'x' probability. Default 0
# update-probability - Update an object previously written to the Cache
#                      with 'x' probability. Default 0
# pure-update-probability - For an update, the probability of a pure
#                           (header + body) update.
# cancel-probability - Cancel an ongoing read or write request
#                      with 'x' probability Default 0. A request
#                      cannot be cancelled if the cache has called
#                      back with CACHE_EVENT_OPEN_READ/CACHE_EVENT_OPEN_WRITE
# abort-probability - Abort a read or write call with 'x'
#                     probability. Default 0.
# mean-doc-size - Average size of the objects. Default 13K
# http-requests - The probability of http requests. The non-http requests
#                  are FTP requests. The cache treats all non-http
#                 (ftp, nntp, streaming) in the same way. Default 1
# host hostname  - Request a document belonging to  this hostname
#                  with 'x' probability. Defaults to 1 host
#                  "www.foobar.com"
# mean-pin-time - Average time in seconds to pin the documents in cache.
# pin-percent - The percent of hotset documents to pin.
