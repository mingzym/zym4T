/**
  Pair of classes implementing the multi-reader, single writer,
  fastest-reader-flow-controlled write functionality.  This is
  similar in spirit to the MIOBuffer/IOBufferReader interfaces, but
  this is intended for coordination among continuations which don't
  share the same lock.

  HotWritePsuedoVC is not a true VConnection -- it only implements
  VC_EVENT_READ_READY and VC_EVENT_WRITE_READY events.  The caller
  must implement the rest to provide true VConnection functionality
  to higher layers.

  Example usage in central data structure:

  @code
  HotWrite hw(new_ProxyMutex());
  @endcode
   
  Example usage in edge connection (writer or reader):

  @code
  HotWriteClient c(My_Continuation);

  c.startAttach();

  My_Continuation::handleEvent(int event, void *data) {
    if (event == VC_EVENT_READ_READY) {
      // fill data into callers MIOBuffer
      // call caller with VC_EVENT_READ_READY
      // reflect MIOBuffer write position back into HotWrite
    } else if (event == VC_EVENT_WRITE_READY) {
      // call caller with VC_EVENT_WRITE_READY

      // reflect IOBufferReaders last read position back into
      // HotWrite
    }
  }

  My_Continuation::close() {
    c.startDetach();
  }
  @endcode
