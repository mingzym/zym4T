  The idea is that log is written sequentially and along with the log
  write, a portion of the directory is synced to disk.  The write
  occurs when the log fills up or when a timer expires.  The sizing of
  dir and log portions can be adjusted.
  
  We will pack directories close together in memory and not keep more
  than a few KB of log in memory.  The syncing process requires doing
  two AIOs -- the header & log, the directories and the footer. With
  coordination among the other disk threads, this could be forced to
  be done without seeks.
