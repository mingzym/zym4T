/**
   internal implementation hidden from rest of code.

   BC_OpenSegment is the interface to the world.  The reason we
   insulate BC_OpenSegment even though it is only used by the cache
   internal code is that we want to be able to cleanly replace the
   current filesystem based implementation with something else such as
   a custom object store and do not want to have to restructure the
   code (which could result in cut and paste errors).
