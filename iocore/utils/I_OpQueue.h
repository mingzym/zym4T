  @section details Details

  Part of the utils library which contains classes that use multiple
  components of the IO-Core to implement some useful functionality. The
  classes also serve as good examples of how to use the IO-Core.

/**
  Operation queue handling multiple outstanding cancellable operations
  that processors can re-use.

  Constraints:
    - No locks are used except when trying to call back continuations
      via Callback. This operation queue therefore needs to be manipulated
      under a single lock, e.g. that of the processor's Continuation.

  Internal operation note:
    - all callbacks on opwaitq are waiting for the processor to become
      'idle' so that another 'operation' can be started.
    - all callbacks on waitcompletionq are waiting for the current
      operation to complete.  This is a queue rather than a single item
      for flexibility.
    - all callbacks on notifyq are to be called back because operation
      completed.

  Variations:
    - to handle multiple outstanding operations, make use of the
      op. identifier in Callback and opIsDone().

    - to handle multiple operations that all complete at same time,
      e.g. a flush() operation, use an op. identifier of '0', and move
      new Callbacks to the waitcompletionq if an operation is already
      in progress.

  Example usage:
  @code
  class MyProcessor {
    // ...
    Action *doOp(Continuation *caller);
    int handleOperationDone(int event, void *data);
    OpQueue opQ;
    Action *m_cbtimer;
  };
  Action *MyProcessor::doOp(Continuation *caller) {
    Callback *cb = opQ.newCallback(caller);
    // take reference to 'cb' so not removed just yet.
    if (opQ.in_progress) {
      opQ.toWaitQ(cb);
      return cb->action();
    } else {
      opQ.in_progress = true;
      opQ.toWaitCompletionQ(cb);
      // start operation
      if (!cb->calledback) {
        return cb->action();
      } else {
        // reentrancy -- called back from within operation
        return ACTION_RESULT_DONE;
      }
    }
  }

  int MyProcessor::handleOperationDone(int event, void *data) {
    if (event == EVENT_INTERVAL && data == m_cbtimer) {
      m_cbtimer = NULL;
      if (opQ.processCallbacks()) {
        // need to call back again
        m_cbtimer = eventProcessor.schedule_in(HRTIME_MSECONDS(10));
      }
      return EVENT_DONE;
    }

    // operation is complete
    opQ.in_progress = false;
    opQ.opIsDone();
    if (opQ.processCallbacks()) {
      // need to call back again
      m_cbtimer = eventProcessor.schedule_in(HRTIME_MSECONDS(10));
    }
    return EVENT_DONE;
