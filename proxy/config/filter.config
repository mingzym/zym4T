# filter.config
#
# The purpose of this file is to specify which http and ftp
#  objects can be obtained through Traffic Server and which
#  headers should be forwarded for http requests. This file 
#  is also used for authentication and authorization
#  configuration.
#
# Each line consists of a set of tag value pairs.  The pairs
#   are in the format  <tag>=<value>
# 
# Each line must include exactly one primary specifier. 
#
#   Primary destination specifiers are
#     dest_domain=
#     dest_host=
#     dest_ip=
#     url_regex=
#
#
# Lines may include any number of the secondary specifiers but
# secondary specifiers may not be duplicated on the same line
#
#   Secondary specifiers are
#     port= 
#     scheme=
#     prefix=
#     suffix=
#     method=
#     time=
#     src_ip=
#     tag=<tag_value> 
#    
#     Note: 1. method secondary specifier is NOT supported in MIXT
#           2. tag is an OPTIONAL directive which specifies a unique identifier
#           for the current record.  This is needed for MIXT, since we may want
#           to select a record that is not necessarily the first one
#           that matches.  Valid values for tag are 'RNI' and 'QT'.
#     
#
#   Authorization/Authentication Specifiers: (used with ntlm, radius, ldap actions)
#     server=<server name>[:<server port>]
#     dn=<Base DN>
#     uid_filter=<UID filter>  
#     bind_dn=<DN of authorized user>
#     bind_pwd_file=<filename where encrypted password is stored>
#     attr=<Attribute Name>
#     attr_val=<Attribute Value>  
#     realm=<Realm Name>
#     redirect_url=<URL to redirect to when error occurs>
#  NOTE: server=, dn=, and uid_filter= must all be specified or not at all
#        bind_dn= and bind_pwd_file= must both be specified or not at all 
#
#
# Each line must include exactly one action.
#  
#     1) action=allow
#     2) action=deny
#
#     3) keep_hdr=<hdr Name>
#     4) strip_hdr=<hdr Name>
#
#     5) action=radius
#       radius action optional parameters:
#           realm= 
#           redirect_url= 
#
#     6) action=ntlm
#	ntlm authentication optional parameters: 
#           realm= 
#           redirect_url= 
#              
#  **** action=ntlm also used for NTLM group authorization rules 
#       Required parameters:
#	    attr=
# 	    attr_val=
#	    bind_dn=
#           bind_pwd_file=
#	Optional paramters: 
#	    server=
#           dn=
#           uid_filter= 
#           realm=
# 	    redirect_url=
#
#     7) action=ldap
#	ldap action optional parameters:
#	    server=
#	    dn=
#	    uid_filter=
#           realm=
#           redirect_url=
#	    attr=
#	    attr_val=
#	    bind_dn=
#           bind_pwd_file=           
#
#       NOTE: 
#	If one or more of the ldap action optional parameters is specified
#	server=, dn=, and uid_filter= must be present. 
#       If none of the parameters are specified, the default LDAP server 
#       from records.config will be used.
#
#	NOTE 2: All LDAP based rules will be enabled only if LDAP authentication
#	is enabled in records.config. If LDAP authentication is disabled in 
#	records.config and an LDAP based rule applies - access will be granted
#	without LDAP authentication.
#
#
# NOTE: In the case of conflicting directives, the directive
#	that appears first applies. 
#
# Example 1:
#  Next line will allow access to internal.foo.com only to users 
#  authenticated by the LDAP server on ldap.foo.com
# 
# dest_host=internal.foo.com action=ldap server=ldap.foo.com dn="o=foo.com"
#
# Example 2: 
#  Next line will allow all users (except ones trying to access internal.foo.com)
#  to access domain foo.com 
# 
# dest_domain=foo.com	action=allow
# 
# Example 3: 
#  Next line will deny access to playboy.com
# 
# dest_domain=playboy.com action=deny
# 
# Example 4: 
#  Next line will allow access to foo401k.fidelity.com only to users from 
#  "Accounting Department." org. unit (ou) authenticated by the LDAP server 
#  on ldap.foo.com
#
# dest_host=foo401k.fidelity.com action=ldap server=ldap.foo.com:389 dn="o=foo.com" attr=ou attr_val="Accounting Department."
#
#  Example 5: 
#  Next line will require everyone not included in any of above rules to be
#  authenticated by the default LDAP server (see records.config for default LDAP server
#  definitions).
#
# dest_ip=0.0.0.0-255.255.255.255 action=ldap
#
#  Example 6: 
# Block traffic to port 25 to prevent SMTP through the proxy/cache
# dest_domain=.	port=25		action=deny
