# C Pre-Processor Program.  This is for using the CPP for things
# -----------------------   other than normal.  (CPP) gets a value
#  which leaves extranious data in the file, and this is undesirable
#  for the kind of text-processing I've got in mind.
# If used, note that it does still leave alot of blank lines where
#  #foo's and #include directives existed in the original text.
