and optionally specify a username and password.  This command requires root privileges.

.SH OPTIONS
The following options are required for the config:upgrade command:

Interactive upgrade allows you to choose the upgrade package from a list.
Reinstall allows you to install an older version of software with default 
configuration settings.
.SS "<url>"

the URL is for FTP, then a username and password are required.  If the URL is for HTTP or HTTPS,
then username and password are optional.
.SS "<username>"
Specifies the username that is used to access the URL on the remote server.
.SS "<password>"
Specifies the password that is used to access the URL on the remote server.
