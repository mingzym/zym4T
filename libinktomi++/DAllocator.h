  DAllocator.h

   A pool allocator with some debugging feature including double free
     detection

   The basic idea behind this allocator is that you can store information
     about each allocated block separately from the block allowing easy
     double free detection.  It's also easy to integrate with the
     memory tracker but I found most fast allocated stuff doesn't lend
     it self well to this approach as it's typically allocated through
     wrapper functions
