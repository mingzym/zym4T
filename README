Apache Traffic Server

Traffic Server is a high-performance building block for cloud services.
It's more than just a caching proxy server; it also has support for
plugins to build large scale web applications.

1. DISCLAIMER

  Apache Traffic Server is an effort undergoing incubation at The
  Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by The Apache Incubator.
  Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a
  further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications,
  and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent
  with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is
  not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of
  the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully
  endorsed by the ASF.
