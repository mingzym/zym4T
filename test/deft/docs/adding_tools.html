<h3> Understanding packages </h3>

<p> Packages are gzipped tarballs of a test tool, it's configuration
and data files and an instantiator script.  The naming scheme is more
than just a convention. </p> 


<ul>
<li> "jtest" is the package name 
<li> "SunOS" is the architecture of the package
<li> "" is the user who created the package
<li> "tb" is arbitrary versioning tag for the package
<li> "02.07.14.22" is the date and time the package was made
</ul>

<p> Do NOT put extra hyphens withing components.  It breaks
everything! </p>

<p> Packages are made using the <code> mkrelease.tcl </code> script
which is checked into the qa tools at <code> sqa/traffic/ts_test
</code> in cvs.  The Makefile.am that has example targets for building
the package. </p>

<p> Each packages must have an <i> instantiator </i> script.  The
instantiator must be named
<code>&lt;pkg_name&gt;-instantiate.&lt;arbitrary_suffix&gt;</code>.  For jtest,
the instantiator is named: <code> jtest-instantiate.pl </code>.
Currently the suffix is not used to make any decisions within the
proc_manager.  The instantiator can be written in any language
(although /bin/sh has limitations on Solaris that keep it from working
but bash is fine) and could be compiled program instead not a script. </p>


<h3> Writing an <i> instantiator </i> </h3>

<p> The instantitator must setup test process for running.  Processes
are run out of a temporary area for testing know as the <b> run_dir
</b>.  The instantiator must make any necessary binaries, config files
and data available from the <b> run_dir </b>.  The location where the
package was unpacked (or localpath was specified) is known as
<b>bin_dir</b>.  It's not necessary for the instantiator to copy
everything to the run directory.  It can symlink binaries or add
command line arguments to tell the process where to find read-only
data files. </p>

<p> Communication between the proc_manager and the instantiator
happens three ways: </p>

<ul> 
<li> name value input pairs are sent to the instantiator on stdin by
the proc_manager </li>
<li> name value output pairs from the instantiator to the proc_manager
are sent on a pipe that opened by the proc_manager prior to forking
the instantiator.  The file descriptor for the pipe is sent as first
and only command line argument to the instantiator.  Stdout is not
used for return information since subprocesses may send diagnostics to
stdout.  </li>
<li> The exit status of the instantitor is read by the proc_manager.
The proc_manager intreprets a non-zero exit status, as failure and the
creation of the instance fails.  </li>
</ul>

<p> The name value pairs both for input and ouput are of the form:
</p>
<pre>  &lt;name&gt;: &lt;value&gt;LF </pre>

<p> The name can consist of any ascii character other than '\0', ':',
CR or LF.  The value can be any ascii character other than '\0', CR, or
LF. However, the use of printable 7bit characters is recommend in both
cases. </p>

<table width="100%" border="2" cellpadding="2">

<tr> <td width="10%"> config_file </td> 
     <td> Absolute to path the file containing "config" argument given
          to the create command.  Not prsent if the config argument
          is not sent. </td> </tr>

     <td> Absolute path to where the tool package was unpacked or
     where localpath was set to.  Always sent.  </td> </tr>
<tr> <td width="10%"> run_dir </td>
     <td> Aboslute path to where the instantiator should prepare the
          test process to be run from.  Sent unless "no_run_dir"
	  argument was made to the create command.</td> </tr>

          the instantitor should prepare the process to be run from
          the "bin_dir"</td> </tr>
<tr> <td width="10%"> ports_avail </td>
     <td> Hyphen separated continugous range of ports available for
          the instantiator to allocate.  The instantiator must
	  allocate ports in order, starting with the lowest first and report
	  the number of ports used in it's output if any ports are
          used. </td> </tr>

     the process follow.  Arguments are broken up along whitespace
     although double quotes and standarding escaping rules can be used
     to create a argument contaning white space.</td> </tr>

     <pre>  port_binding: server 12310 rafPort 12311\n</pre>
     <p> <b> rafPort </b> is a special name which indicates the port 
         <b> raf_instance() </b>will use for querying the process via
	 RAF. </p></td> </tr>

     <td> positive interger value (in ascii) of ports used from the port
          range passed as an input parameter to the instantiator. </td>

<tr> <td width="10%"> env_vars </td>
     <td> Space separated list of environment value pairs (of the form
          name=value) to add to the test processes enviroment before
          it is execed.  Standard quoting rules apply for allowing spaces
          in the values.</td> </tr>

<h3> Parsing the output </h3>

<p> All stderr and stdout output from every test process is stamped,
and sent to the <b> test_log_collate </b> processes which merges all
the streams into one file.  In addition, any calls <b> add_to_log()</b> 
cause entries to be added to the log file.  Parsing the log file is
the ONLY place where a pass or fail determination is made for a
test.</p>

<p> In order to facilitate easy testing writing but allow for complex
parsing log, the log parser makes use of perl modules.  When adding a 
tool to the framework, it's generally necessary to add a parsing
module to it though for very simple tools the generic parser may do
the job. </p>

<p> A parser is perl module which defines the function <code>
process_test_log_line(String $instance_id, String $level,
StringRef $line) </code>.   <code> process_test_line </code> must return
one of the following three values: </p>

<ul>
<li> <code> "ok" </code> - the line is neither a warning on an error </li>
<li> <code> "warning" </code> - the line indicates a warning </li>
<li> <code> "error" </code> - the line indicates an error </li>
</ul>

<p> The easiest way to write your own parser is to use an existing one
from <code> traffic/test/parsers </code> as template. </p>

<p> In order to prevent each test from having to specify a parser for
each instance, instance name prefixes can be mapped to a parser by
default.  The prefix is all alpha characters before an numeric
characters in the name.  For example, if the instance name is 
<code> syntest1 </code>the prefix is <code> syntest</code>.
The default mappings are made in <code> parse_dispatcher.pm
</code> in the <code>%predefined_mappings</code> hash.  If the there
is no entry for the instance name prefix is
<code>%predefined_mappings</code>, the <code> parse_generic.pm </code>
is used for that instance. </p>

<p> In the cases where the default parser isn't appropriate, 
the test script can use <b>set_log_parser()</b> to override the 
default. </p>
