<h2 align="center">  Getting Started Testing Traffic Server with DEFT </h2>

<h2> Introduction </h2>

<p> DEFT stands for Distributed Extensible Framework (for) Testing.
DEFT provides the ability to run test scripts written in perl,
automatically install test packages on remote machines, manage
the test processes on both local and remote machines and analyze 
the results. </p> 

<h2> Preparing machines </h2>

<p> <b>Note</b>: cachedev, npdev, tsdev, proxydev, lindev, lundev &amp; dicer
have already been setup. If you are using one of these machines,  you
can skip ahead to <a href="#using"> "Using the Framework"</a></p>

<p> Packages and setup work needed install the framework:</p>
<ul>

<li> ssh (for remote tests) </li>
<li> bash </li>
<li> /inktest link </li>
<li> perl in /inktest/dist </li>
</ul>

<p> <b> SSH </b> is required to use remote nodes.  The process manager 
for the testing system is pushed out and started using ssh.
Installing and configuring ssh is the most difficult part of preparing 
the machines.  Authenication by rsa keys must set up for the system to
work.  The standard package is OpenSSH which is available at
<a href="http://www.openssh.org"> openssh.org </a>.</p>

<p> After installing ssh on the machine, you need use the
<i>ssh-keygen</i> on the machine you plan to start the tests from to
generate an rsa key.  The key will be put into
<i>~/.ssh/identity.pub</i>.  Copy the <i>identity.pub</i> to
<i>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</i> on your remote machines.  SSH is picky
about the permissions of the your home directory, the .ssh directory
and the authorized_keys file so make sure all writable only the user
and not group or world.   To test your key setup, trying ssh'ing to
all the remote hosts.  <i>ssh -v</i> useful for
finding out why key based authentication failed.</p>

<p> <b> bash </b> is used for both local and remote tests and ideally
installed as /bin/bash or /usr/bin/bash. </p>

<p> <b> /inktest </b> is the default location used for files and package
installations during a test run.  Symlink /inktest to a location with some
space available and make sure the directory it is symlinked to is
writable by the userid you will be running the test as.  For shared
machines, it's easiest to set the directory to 777 permissions. </p>

<p> <b> perl </b> needs to be installed in <b> /inktest/dist</b>.
It's best to use the same build as is used to link against the
interpretor in the test framework to prevent weird problems.  Tar'ed
distributions compiled for /inktest/dist are available </p>

<h2> Using the framework </h2>

<p> The easiest and quickest way to use the framework is straight out
of the traffic_server source tree in the mainline.   If you have a
recent checkout, you already have the source code since it's been
added to the testing module.  If your checkout is crufty, you'll need
to "cvs update -d test" (from the traffic/ dircectory) and then
reconfigure your build area.  On Solaris, you need to have run configure
with <code> --with-gcc </code> to build the framework.</p>

<p> In your build area, enter test sub directory and <i>gmake</i>.  After
the gmake completes, then <i>gmake install</i>.  The install will create a 
<i>traffic/deft-install</i> directory which contains the components for
testing.  The reason that deft-install directory is outside of your
build area is to support running tests across multiple platforms. </p>
 
<p> Now <i>cd</i> upto <i>traffic/deft-install</i>.  The two most
important options for starting a test are <b> picking the base port
</b> and knowing what test script to you want to run.  With the base port, you
want a range of 100 ports that aren't being used by anyone else on the
box.  For a our first example test, we'll run systest.</p>   

<p> When firing up a test we need to let the testing system know where
our traffic_server is located.  If our traffic_server is in our build
tree, we can just specify the build dir, for example <b> sun_dbg </b>.
If the traffic_server we want to test resides outside of our build
tree, we need to provide the absolute path.</p>  

<p>In either case, the directory that the Traffic Server install
resides in (not the bin directory itself but the directory that
contains the bin, config and logs subdirectories) must have <b>
ts-instantiate.pl </b> in it.  If you are using TS from a build area
with a recent mainline checkout, the <i> gmake install </i> for setting
up traffic_server already placed the file.  If you are using TS
installed from a customer package, or an earlier code branch, or you
haven't updated your mainline tree recently, you need to manually copy
<b> ts-instantiate.pl </b> from the <i> traffic/proxy </i> directory
of a recent mainline checkout into your Traffic Server directory. </p>

<p> There's a script for
starting up test process called run_test.pl.  The first argument is
the location of traffic_server and the remaining arguments are passed
to the test_exec binary.  Assuming our port range starts at 15400,
we'd use: </p>
<pre>     ./run_test.pl sun_dbg -p 15400 -s syntest.pl </pre>

<p> to fire up our example test.  If you want to see the test log as
the test is being run, append <code> -v </code> to fire up a window
based view of the log file. Once we start this process, we
should see output that resembles the following:  </p>
<pre>  [Feb  4 17:53:29.273] STATUS: test_exec v&#36;Revision: 1.25 &#36; running
  [Feb  4 17:53:29.276] STATUS: Running test script syntest.pl
  [Feb  4 17:53:29.294] STATUS: Starting proc_manager on localhost
  Waiting for syntest1 to exit
</pre>

<p> Once the test completes, all the output from the test components
will be passed to the test parser which will tell us how many warnings
and errors the test generated.  Here's some example output:
</p>

<pre>  error: [Mon Feb  4 17:53:47.048 syntest1 stdout] ----- Test Tests/Bad-Servers/bad-server.cfg (bad-server.cfg, server doesn't send back any headers) ----- failed

  #### 5 Errors; 1  Warnings ####
</pre>

<h3> Where is my log file or core file? </h3>

<p> All the files for a particular test run are located under the
"stuff_path" which is set by the <code> -d </code> option.  The 
default is <code> /inktest.</code>  To prevent tests from running
into each other, a sub directory is made by concatinating the username
running test and a uniquer string (which is set by the <code> -u
</code> option and defaults to <code>-0</code>.   Under that subdirectory,
you'll find a <code> run </code> sub directory containing further
subdiretories with instance names.  If you are looking for a core
file, it will be under the <code> run/&lt;instance_name&gt; </code>
subdirectory unless your test process use <code> chdir </code> system
call.  On the machine you started up the test on, your log file is at
<code> log/test.log </code>.


<h2> What's next </h2>
