<h4> <a name="ts_config">
How do I write traffic_server config file foobar.config? </a></h4>
 
<p> You can write <b>any</b> Traffic Server config file by adding a
section to the string you pass to <i>TestExec::pm_create_instance</i>
under the <i>config</i> section.  All the details are at <a href
a="http://internal.examle.com/">
here</a>.  Here's a general example config string:</p>

<pre>[records.config]

proxy.config.diags.output.status      SE
proxy.config.diags.output.note 	      SE
proxy.config.diags.output.warning     SE
proxy.config.diags.output.error       SE
proxy.config.cache.storage_filename   storage.config
proxy.config.proxy_name               deft.inktomi.com
proxy.config.hostdb.size              50000
add CONFIG proxy.config.core_limit INT -1

[foobar.config]

This text will appear in config/foo.bar.config
</pre>

<h4> <a name="ts_service">
How do I tell traffic_server where to contact another test service?
</a></h4>

<p> To tell the TS where another service is (for example, jtest for a
reverse proxy), start up that service first.  Then use a %%()
substition of a port binding from that service in a appropriate place
in jtest.config.  An example test case that does exactly this is
<b>jtest-revproxy.pl</b>.</p>

<h4> <a name="pkg_ts">
How do I make DEFT package for Traffic Server?</a></h4>

<p> There is a script and a Makefile target to automatically do this.
It's available in the source tree at
<b>traffic/test/deft_package_ts.pl</b>.  From the test directory, you
can use: </p>
<pre>  gmake pkg_ts </pre>
<p> which will create Traffic Server package in
<b>traffic/deft-install/packages</b>. </p>

<p> If you want to package a release engineering build or any other
build tree without running the Makfile target:
<pre> deft_package_ts.pl -b &lt;top of build area&gt; </pre>

<p> Currently, you must package on the same architecture as the TS was
built on. </p>

<p> While DEFT is completely capable of using TS packages, most
existing scripts set <i>localpath</i> for Traffic Server to
<i>%%(ts_localpath)</i>.  I've modified the example scripts to only 
set localpath for TS if <i>%%(ts_localpath)</i> has been set but
other tests will need to be converted. </p>

<p> In order not to have <i>run_test.pl</i> automatically 
set <i>ts_localpath</i>, do not pass the traffic_server build as the
first argument.</p>

<h4> <a name="debug">
My test package did not start up, how to do I debug it? </a></h4>

<p>  First look at the test log.  Depending on the parser for the
package, you may get the releveant part of the test log dumped as an
error or warning after the test has finished.  If you are not seeing
an error or warning, go look at the raw test log.  You can get access
to it either through the graphic log viewer which is invoked by
starting <i>run_test.pl</i> with '-v' or by looking in
<i>/inktest/&lt;username&gt;-0/log/test.log</i>.

<p> If you still don't see anything helpful, run the test with some debug
tags on in the test executor.  The most helpful one usually is
<b>raf</b>.  Debug tags are invoked the same way they are for Traffic
Server, using the '-T' option.  For raf, pass <b>'-T raf'</b> to
run_test.pl.</p>

<p> If you still can not tell what the problem, try starting up your
installed test packages by hand.  Deft does not delete an
instance directory until you run another test so it's easy to inspect
and try to run your test process.  Just cd to
<i>/inktest/&lt;username&gt;-0/run/&lt;instance_name&gt;</i>.  Then
run your test process manually.  Don't forget to use an arguments that
test script would start up the process with.</p> 

<p> At this step, we are pulling out the heavy artillery.  We want to
run the components of DEFT manually so we can get debug tags from the
proc_manager and run dbx on the proc_manager if necessary.  The first
thing you need to do is start up all the proc_managers manually.  This
is much easier to do if you are running your test on localhost as you
only have one start up. To start the proc_manager manually with all
debug tags on (use your own base port
and substitute a different architecture suffix if not running on sparc):</p>
<pre>  cd /inktest/&lt;username&gt;-0/
  ./proc_manager-SunOS -p 12400 -d . '-T.*'
</pre>

<p> If you don't want the debug tags, leave off '-T.*'.  In another
window, start your test as you normally would but add '-m'.  For
example:
<pre>  ./run_test.pl -p 12400 -s jtest-example.pl -m</pre>

<p> You won't have a log collator when starting up manually.  If you
want to look at the log it will be in
/inktest/&lt;username&gt;-0/log/log.&lt;proc_manager.pid&gt;. </p>

<p> Starting up the components manually is really the keys to the
kingdom since it allows you start any component.  You can run the log
collator if you want to as well, but starting it manaully and using
the '-L' option to the proc_manager to tell it where the log_collator
is running. </p>
