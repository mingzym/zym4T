Readme for Samples for SDKtest_server Plugins
=============================================

hello_world.c
- Demonstrate the most basic routine of writing the SDKtest_server plugin

  This example simply prints a statement to standard error within the 
  INKPluginInit() to make sure that the plugin is successfully loaded
  when SDKtest_server starts running.

SimSynthServer.c
- Simulate the default way of responding requests by the SDKtest_server  
  When SDKtest_server received a request from a client in the
  following format:

 	GET [www.hostname.com:port]/serial_number/lengthxxx HTTP/1.0
        Accept: */*
        Host: hostname:port

  it parses the header and looks for the number of bytes requested.
  (which should be the number after the string 'length')  Then it 
  fills up the response buffer with appropriate response header and
  then a string of 'XXXXX....XXE' with that number of bytes.

SimSynthServerCache.c
- Simulate the default way of responding requests by the SDKtest_server
  with cachability specified in the server response header in some
  percentage.  It responses the client requests in the same way as 
  SimSynthServer.c example.  It only differs by adding a
  'Cache-Control' header in the MIME field in the response header.

  Added Options in Synth_server.config -
    cachability : percentage of cachable response we want to generate

LogRequest.c
- Log the requests that are received from the clients into a file 
  specified in the SDKtest_server.config file.

  Added Options in Synth_server.config -  
    log_path : full path of the log file 
               eg. /home/user/file.log

  Note: This example only works for single origin_server setup.  

CheckContentServer.c
- Response the client requests in the format of '0123456789012..' 
  until it reaches the number of bytes the client requested.  
  In that case, the client can check the correctness of the responded 
  documents.

  Note: This example needs to work with CheckContentClient plugin
        for SDKtest_client.
