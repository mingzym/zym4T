  
  Climate plugin
  Creation date: 09/06/01

  Log information regarding transactions (headers, bytes,
  timing) in a specific log file (climate.log).

  Used by the Climate Lab log analysis that needs precise
  timing information not available in custom logs.

  Based on the profiler plug-in by Franck Chastagnol
  and the output-header plug-in.


Configuration:

  add climate.so in the plugin.config file.


Argument: 

   None except if compiled with option ROLL_LOG. In this case
   an optional argument can be passed to indicate the number of records
   each profiler log file should contain (default is 1,000,000).


Synopsis:

  Generate a custom log file (climate.log) which include information like:
  - full headers for client requests and server responses
  - header and body bytes transferred for client and server requests and responses
  - timing information
