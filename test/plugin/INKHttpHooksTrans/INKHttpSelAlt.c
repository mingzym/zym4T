/*
Cannot asynchronously process this event. Same as a non-blocking event,
i.e., event does not have to be reenabled at any level.

Tests that register, receive and process event INK_HTTP_SELECT_ALT_HOOK. This
test was written as a stand-alone plug-in since there appeared to be
interactions with other events that interfered with this event. Once this
code works, it could be incorporated into the INKHttpTxn.c plug-in since this
is a test of "global" hook/event processing.
