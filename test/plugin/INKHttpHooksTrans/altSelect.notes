I don't follow. My recollection is that if a transformation
is occurring, the default is
that transformed content, and only transformed content,
is cached. (See the description of INKHttpTxnTransformedRespCache.)

If you set INKHttpTxnUntransformedRespCache(txnp, 1),
then untransformed content is cached. I believe the way
to make sure that both transformed and untransformed
content is cached is: to set both

INKHttpTxnUntransformedRespCache(txnp, 1)
and
INKHttpTxnTransformedRespCache(txnp, 1)

This is what the description of INKHttpTxnUntransformedRespCache
seems to be saying. (It's directly from the engineer who designed it).
- but I could be wrong. this part of the api has not been
tested.

I agree. This is a mistake. I'll fix it.

Yes. Sorry. Hope it gets easier. I'll try to clarify these parts of the
book.
