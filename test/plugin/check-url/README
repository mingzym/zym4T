Description: 
Exercises APIs covered in the URLs section of Chap 7.  This is a very
elimentary plugin which simply prints out various parts of the request URLs.
This plugin covers the following APIs - 
- INKUrlCopy
- INKUrlCreate
- INKUrlDestroy
- INKUrlParse
- INKUrlftpTypeGet/Set
- INKUrlHostGet/Set
- INKUrlHttpFragmentGet/Set
- INKUrlHttpQueryGet/Set
- INKUrlLengthGet/Set
- INKUrlPasswordGet/Set
- INKUrlPathGet/Set
- INKUrlPortGet/Set
- INKUrlSchemeGet/Set
- INKUrlStringGet/Set
- INKUrlUserGet/Set

Usage: check-url-0.so

Debug tags: request

Note: With the debug output enabled, the plugin dumps lots of output into 
traffic.out.  The debug output should be turned off in case of load 
testing this plugin.  Moreover, printing debug output also slows down 
jtest throughput.

Note: 
The level of testing of the APIs covered in this plugin is really 
"superficial", for e.g., sometimes to the level of calling the API just once 
with a set of valid values and just checking the expected output.  The task of 
writing new "intelligent" plugins to test the APIs thoroughly is on-going 
which would be supplementary to this plugin.

And lastly, I have used lots of "goto" here.  I too hate gotos.. :)
